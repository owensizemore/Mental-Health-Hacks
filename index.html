      <h2 class="title is-4 is-spaced">Our Analysis</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-spaced">
        In an analysis of data collected in the past year by the CDC about levels of anxiety and depression we found the following:<br style="margin-bottom:10px;">
        1. For top 10 states with highest reported percentages of adults feeling symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder during COVID, there has been a lot of fluctuation in mental health in the past year.<br style="margin-bottom:10px;">
        2. In the past year, the percentage of adults feeling symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders in the USA fell between 23.4 and 33.9.<br style="margin-bottom:10px;">
        3. In the United States, there is a slight disparity between southern/west coat states and the rest of the USA in terms of mental wellness as indicated by anxiety and depression symptoms.<br style="margin-bottom:10px;">
        This is why we have created Sapphire, to help adults across the USA manage their own mental health and decrease their levels of anxiety and depression.

      <h2 class="title is-4 is-spaced">Why is My Mental Health Important?</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle is-5 is-spaced">Public health experts say that "mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness." Being aware of your mental health is an important aspect of self care and can greatly improve your quality of life.</h3>
